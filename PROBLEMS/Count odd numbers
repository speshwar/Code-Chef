// Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
Example 2:

Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

//SOLUTION

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void countOdds(int low, int high) {
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=low;i<=high;i++){
            if(i%2!=0){
                count+=1;
            }
        }
        cout<<count;
    }
};
int main()
{
    int low,high;
    cout<<"low = ";
    cin>>low;
    cout<<"high = ";
    cin>>high;
    
    Solution s;
    s.countOdds(low,high);
    return 0;
}
